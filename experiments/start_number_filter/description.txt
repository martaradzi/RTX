The experiment took 4000509ms to run
Ignored results (in ticks): 2000
Sample size: 20
Number of cars change  every (in ticks): 5000
Data gathered for 3000 tics each time

The partial clustering was performed on data of size: 4

Avg number of trips per windwo: 1189.7Features the model trained on: 
avg_overhead
std_overhead
var_overhead
median_overhead
q1_overhead
q3_overhead
p9_overhead

data was checked for belonging to the appropriate 'car numbers' in the simulation
